### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Wei, an aspiring full-stack web developer. A web development class that I thought wouldn't be interesting turns out to be my favorite class. From that point onward, I have been looking into different technologies online and learning materials outside of the classroom. My goal is to polishing my skills and learning more and more technologies in regards to web development. I am now focusing on data engineering.

I have deep knowledge in front-end and back-end, data structures, algorithms, teamwork, and communication. Equipped with Master's degrees in Accounting and Finance. Adept with JavaScript, React, Python, Node/Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, HTML, CSS, and Git. Love to make everything in an order that makes logical sense.

Technical proficiencies include:

Frontend: React, Bootstrap

Backend: Node.js, noSQL, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose

Languages: JavaScript, Python

Iâ€™m looking for any opportunities. Feel free to reach me - wcheng2@babson.edu
